# PaperPlugin
Template which creates you everything to get started with creating Minecraft plugins with Paper with Kotlin support enabled

## Notes
1. To compile properly, change path of .jar in artifacts and maybe try remove Java or Kotlin file.

2. Sometimes, Kotlin code won't work so Java is still better option in my opinion
